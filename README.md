# Version-1-An-End-to-End-Model-Training-and-Testing-Pipeline
This repository provides a complete guide for training and testing a model end-to-end. It describes the necessary steps for project setup, data organization and preprocessing, model training and inference pipelines, benchmarking experiments, and documentation. For a demo I will be performing Instance Segmentation via Visual Transformers.
